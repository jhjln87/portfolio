                <p>I’ve been associated with John as his professor at BYU-Idaho, in which I’ve seen excellent work quality and ethics.  More importantly, as a former company CEO, founder, and college recruiter, I see John as exactly the right combination of competence, drive, and social skills.  This is someone whom I would hire in one of my companies.</p>
