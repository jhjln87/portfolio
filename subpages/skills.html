                <h3>LDS Mission</h3>
                <p>For two years I went from town to town helping individuals grow their faith in God and help them make covenants with Him. How does this transfer to sales? No matter how I felt I had to go out there every day and give the message. I had to face much rejection in the day to day life, giving me the ability to handle rejection but still build from it. I also gained experience in public speaking, both in larger congregations and in small team settings. I had to opportunity to teach others and to lead other missionaries as well. This mission also taught me the process of a good sales pitch including skills such as interpersonal connection; creating concise, direct, and personable pitches; how to respect others while simultaneously offering something; and more.</p>

                <h3>Door to door</h3>
                <p>This summer, I will begin working with Aiden Beal, a sales group manager, doing door to door fiber sales. This will give me direct experience not just in sales but also introduce me to what it's like to sell a technology.</p>
