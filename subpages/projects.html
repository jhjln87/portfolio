                <p>Originally built by Kendall Olson, Sean Heiner, and Parker Dragovich in a hackathon. As a team project we transformed it into a functioning website with group pages and a login system, as well as touching up the UI and adding mobile useability.</p>
                <p>For this project, I did some of the graphic design, and a majority of the CSS cleanup, reogranization, and commenting, for code readability and for minor bug fixes.</p>

                <p>This is only for theory. This is not actually a business.</p>
                <p>For an AI course, we were given one hour to create a presentable business using only AI. We generated a 14-part business plan, a logo, motto, elevator pitch, and 10-step marketing plan.</p>
                <p>From that, we AI generated a website (linked at the top), a 13-slide presentation, and used AI to create a guinea pig video that would present for us.</p>

                <p>This was my very first website, and my final project in high school. I was to do 30+ hours of research, so I chose to learn very basic C++ and create two zero-sum games using three coding languages. I then compared these games and created this site as my presentation for it.</p>
                <p>I created 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' and 'Gambling' using HTML, CSS, and beginner JavaScript</p>
                <p>I created 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' and 'Tic Tac Toe' using Python</p>

                <h4>Weather sensor and interpreter</h4>
                <p>For two college projects, I hooked up an Arduino board and temperature sensor to a program. This program would interpret the temperature and humidity, as well as scraping wind speed off a scraping site for my local area. It would calcluate the 'feels like' temperature and give suggestions for how many layers you should wear.</p>
                <img src="../images/tempSensor.png">
                <p>For submission purposes, I was required to make an <a href="https://github.com/jhjln87/cse111/blob/main/findTempArduino.ino" target="_blank">Arduino file</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/jhjln87/cse111/blob/main/clothes.py" target="_blank">Python file</a>, and a <a href="https://github.com/jhjln87/cse111/blob/main/test_clothes.py" target="_blank">Python test file</a>.</p>

                <a href="https://github.com/jhjln87/ecen240-dump/tree/main/Lab_6_arithmeticLogicUnit" target="_blank">Digital Arithmetic Logic Unit</a>
                <p>For a college lab, I was to create a four-function arithmetic logic unit with functions XOR, OR, AND, and ADD. I also had to create a multiplexer from scratch and have it determine the function performed. My last task was to write SystemVerilog code to replicate the original schematic. In my free time, I doubled the use of this, and added the functions of LSL, LSR, as well as 1's complement and subtraction. I also combined my four-input multiplexers to make an eight-input multiplexer.</p>
                <img src="../images/lab6.jpg">
                <p>The image contains my SystemVerilog code and an FPGA. I hooked up the FPGA to allow for the two inputs to be the leftmost and rightmost four buttons in the row on the bottom. The five buttons lined up in a plus control my MUX.</p>
